sllvm
=====

A partial port of the LLVM infrastructure to Scala

Introduction
============

Some analyses on LLVM (http://llvm.org/) IR could be more conveniently and
succintly written in Scala. SLLVM is not intended to be bindings (see
https://bitbucket.org/eligottlieb/jllvm for Java bindings) or a complete port of
the framework. Rather, analyses in SLLVM are intended to augment the existing
C++ pass system. SLLVM is also not a convenient way for generating LLVM IR; for
that, see http://code.google.com/p/slem/.

LLVM Model
==========

TODO: describe class hierarchy briefly

SLLVM aims to present a simpler version of the API. Some differences currently
include:
  * The GlobalValue class does not exist
  * Function subclasses Value, not GlobalValue

Roadmap
=======

More detail in TODO. The overall goal is to support a future pointer analysis
framework.

* Parse/re-emit IR
* Interactive graphviz visualization of IR
* Accumulate convenience methods for core constructs
