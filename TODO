# TODO #

- make output of parsed sllvm be identical to input
  - var-args
  - unescape constant strings
  - module stores type table (and handles recursive types)
  - run through tests for the rest

- Immutable construction (aka really clean code)
  - regroup to even get rid of named_inst and laters
  - fill out User operands
  - anywhere with factories, override equals()

- better graphviz output
  - interprocedural caller/callee edges
- wacky procedural generation visualization experiments

- Build script(s)
- Bigger tests
- optimizations
  - left factor the grammar... prevent backtracking
  - scale... how to avoid reading whole file?
