# TODO #

- LLVM support (http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html)
  - declarations...
  - named types...
  - semantics of var-args
  - fill out User operands
  - gep is hard
  - retain more aux info to make parsing/printing IR idempotent
    - alignment, target lines, etc

- Immutable construction
  - i broke things like args (and the type inference believes my lies!)
  - things like BB succs aren't set... go through and make sure all these're fine

- maybe builtins for malloc/scanf

- Prettyprinting LLVM (non IR-dump toString)
- graphviz

- "Pass" to split BBs at a CallInst

- Build script(s)
